OSM objects can be of three types for our use case: `nodes`, `ways` and `areas`. These objects are mapped as:

`node`: `count` <br>
`way`: `lenght` <br>
`area`: `area` <br>

The OSM tags that are currently mapped are:

`amenity`, <br>
`building`, <br>
`craft`, <br>
`cycleway`, <br>
`emergency`, <br>
`highway`, <br>
`historic`, <br>
`landuse`, <br>
`leisure`, <br>
`man_made`, <br>
`military`, <br>
`natural`, <br>
`office`, <br>
`power`, <br>
`public_transport`, <br>
`railway`, <br>
`shop`, <br>
`sport`, <br>
`tourism`

These are split in specified or unspecified. the Unspecified tags are: `craft`, `emergency`, `historic`, 
`leisure`, `man_made`, `military`, `natural`, `office`, `power`, `sport`, `tourism`, which are given a general 
`count`, `length` and `area`. 

The others have specific mappings and are arranged in groups. Below these are detailed.
